# Leeds Digital Festival App


## Overview

Plan to create a website and iOS and Android app for Leeds Digital Festival.
I'll be doing a talk about its creation at the festival the key points I would like to talk about are:
 - Building on Azure serverless
 - Pricing benefits of serverless
 - One code base for the apps
 - Performance

We'll be loading the talks from the Wordpress database that backs the Leeds Digital Festival website.
It'll be built on Azure, using Blob Storage, Functions.
Looking at either Azure App Center or Github actions for the build process, potentially manual releases depending on time constrains.


We want to keep the app really simple and around the talk that are going on.
